Hi! I'm Shengnan An (安晟男).
I'm currently a researcher in Meituan.
I graduated with a Ph.D from Xi'an Jiaotong University and MSRA in 2025.
My Ph.D advisor is Prof. Nanning Zheng.

My current research interest is to explore the capability boundaries of large language models, such as mathematical reasoning, inductive reasoning, coding, and long-context understanding & generation.
